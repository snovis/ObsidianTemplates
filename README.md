# ObsidianTemplates
This repository holds template files for Obsidian for Personal Knowledge Management.

I do my best to post videos and resources to help people implement a personal knowledge management system I call **Where Not What**.

This vault contains some simple, (and not so simple) templates meant to work with Obsidian.

You will need at least two main plugins to get the most out of these.

1. Templater - a very powerful templating plugin that allows a template to execute javascript.
2. Dataview - another very powerful plugin that allows you to treat your notes like a database.
