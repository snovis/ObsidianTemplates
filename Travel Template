How to Use This Template.
This block between the double percentage signs `%` is a comment. And you can delete 
this whole section once you know how to use it.  This is a very simple template
with no Javascript code.  You can customize it anyway you want, but I have found it very
useful to consolidate a lot of information - including links, pictures, and details
so before I leave I'm prepared.

Where do I store travel notes?  In the folder that makes the most sense. It can be
a project folder, or an Area Folder.  You can use dataview to list every file 
that has the tag TravelCard (you will probably want to exclude files that are in the 4 Ardchives folder.)
